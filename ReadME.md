##### Type Check

Type checking is the activity of providing that the operands of an operator are of compatible types. A compatible type is one that is legal for the operator or is enabled under language rules to be implicitly modified by compiler-generated code to a legal type. This automatic conversion is known as coercion.

```sh
npm run type-check 
or
npm run type-check:watch
```
